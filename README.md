# API Data Wrangling miniproject

Use of Quandl API to get equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE). We'll try and analyze the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, looking for highest and lowest opening, closing prices, average daily trading volume and the median trading volume, dealing with outliers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Create an `.api-key` file in the root of the repository with your Quandl API key.
- [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
- Run Anaconda Navigator and launch a jupyter notebook and open the file `api_data_wrangling_mini_project.ipynb`
 - Install request package from Terminal.

Others libraries (scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, collections and datetime) do not require installation (default packages)

### Installing

```bash
conda install request
```
